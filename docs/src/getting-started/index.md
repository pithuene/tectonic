# Getting Started

This chapter of the book will introduce you to Tectonic, with a special emphasis
on the ways that it’s different from the TeX systems that you might have seen
before. We’ll assume a very basic familiarity with TeX and LaTeX, and that you
know how to use a command-line interface on your computer.

The sections in this chapter are:

1. [Install Tectonic](./install.md)
2. [Build your first document](./first-document.md)
3. [Use a Unicode font](./unicode.md)
